python-dali — lighting control interface
========================================

DALI ("Digital Addressable Lighting Interface") defines how lighting
control gear (eg. fluorescent ballasts, LED dimmers) and input devices
(push buttons, motion detectors, etc.) should interoperate.  It is
standardised in IEC 62386.

IEC 62386 contains several parts.  Part 101 contains general
requirements for all system components, part 102 covers general
requirements for control gear, and part 103 describes general
requirements for control devices.  Parts 2xx extend part 102 with
lamp-specific extensions and parts 3xx extend part 103 with input
device specific extensions.

This library has been written with reference to the following documents:

- IEC 62386-101:2014 (general requirements for system components)
- IEC 62386-102:2014 (general requirements for control gear)
- IEC 62386-103:2014 (general requirements for control devices)
- IEC 62386-201:2009 (fluorescent lamps)
- IEC 62386-202:2009 (self-contained emergency lighting)
- IEC 62386-205:2009 (supply voltage controller for incandescent lamps)
- IEC 62386-207:2009 (LED modules)
- IEC 62386-301:2017 (particular requirements for push button input devices)

I do not have copies of the other parts of the standard; they are
fairly expensive to obtain.  The library is designed to be extensible;
adding support for the other parts ought to be easy and
self-contained.

The ``dali.memory`` module supports the extended memory bank
specifications created and maintained by the `Digital Illumination
Interface Alliance`_:

- DiiA DALI Part 251 — Memory Bank 1 Extension
- DiiA DALI Part 252 — Energy Reporting
- DiiA DALI Part 253 — Diagnostics & Maintenance

Python versions supported
-------------------------

This library currently requires Python version 3.6 or later.

Stability
---------

Some of the code in this project is experimental and its API is
subject to change. Modules with stable APIs are noted below.

Library structure
