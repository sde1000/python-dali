"""Device addressing

Addressing for control gear is described in IEC 62386-102 section 7.2.
Forward frames can be addressed to one of 64 short addresses, one of
16 group addresses, to all devices, or to all devices that do not have
a short address assigned.

Addressing for control devices is described in IEC 62386-103 section
7.2.1.  Command frames can be addressed to one of 64 short addresses,
one of 32 group addresses, to all devices, or to all devices that do
not have a short address assigned.

Addressing for event messages is described in IEC 62386-103 section
7.2.2.  Decoding of event messages is currently not implemented.
