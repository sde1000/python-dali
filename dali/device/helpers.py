    Part 103 defines five different event message addressing schemes, as per
    Table 8 of IEC 62386.103. These are: "Instance", "Device",
    "Device/Instance", "Device Group" and "Instance Group". Four of these
    only rely on data contained within the message itself, however the
    "Device/Instance" addressing scheme does not include information in the
    24 bits of the message to indicate the instance type - which means that
    without further knowledge it is not possible to decode these messages.

    DeviceInstanceTypeMapper stores a mapping from the address and instance
    number of a device to the instance type, thus allowing a higher-level
    system to decode "Device/Instance" messages.

    One instance of DeviceInstanceTypeMapper should be created for each DALI

    through the `from_frame()` method.
